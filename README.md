>**Abstract.** Recent advancements in mobile sensing and wearable technologies create new opportunities to improve our understanding
of how people experience their environment. By analysing data collected from this type of sensors, we can
study spatial variations in people’s physiological response in relation to the surrounding environment, allowing us to
provide urban planners objective metrics on how individuals experience urban design elements. Currently, an important
urban design issue is the adaptation of infrastructure to increasing cycle and e-bike use. Using data collected
from 12 cyclists on a cycling highway between two municipalities in The Netherlands, this paper presents a methodological
framework for quantifying and analyzing spatiotemporal variations of emotion and their association with
surrounding environmental features. We coupled location and physiological measurements of high spatiotemporal
resolution to model and examine relationships between cyclists’ physiological arousal (operationalized as skin conductance
responses) and environmental characteristics (operationalized as visible land cover). We specifically took a
within-participants multilevel modeling approach to determine relationships between different types of viewable land
cover and emotional arousal, while controlling for speed, direction, distance to roads, and directional change. Surprisingly,
our model suggests ride segments with views of more natural, recreational, agricultural, and forested areas
were more emotionally arousing for participants. Conversely, segments with views of more developed areas were less
arousing. The presented methodological framework, spatial-emotional analyses, and findings from hierarchical multilevel
modeling provide new opportunities for spatial, data-driven approaches to portable sensing and urban planning
research. Furthermore, our findings have implications for design of infrastructure to optimize cycling experiences.
